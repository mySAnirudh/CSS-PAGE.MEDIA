    Paged media differ from continuous media in that the content of the document is 
split into one or more discrete pages. Paged media includes paper, 
transparencies, pages that are displayed on computer screens, etc.
The CSS2 standard introduces some basic pagination control features that let 
authors help the browser figure out how to best print their documents.
The CSS2 page model specifies how a document is formatted within a 
rectangular area -- the page box -- that has a finite width and height. These 
features fall into two groups:
 CSS2 features that define a particular page layout.
 CSS2 features that control the pagination of a document.
Defining Pages: The @page Rule
The CSS2 defines a "page box", a box of finite dimensions, in which content is 
rendered. The page box is a rectangular region that contains two areas:
 The page area: The page area includes the boxes laid out on that page. 
The edges of the page area act as the initial containing block for layout 
that occurs between page breaks.
 The margin area: It surrounds the page area.
You can specify the dimensions, orientation, margins, etc., of a page box within 
an @page rule. The dimensions of the page box are set with the 'size' property. 
The dimensions of the page area are the dimensions of the page box minus the 
margin area.
For example, the following @page rule sets the page box size to 8.5 x 11 inches 
and creates '2cm' margin on all sides between the page box edge and the page 
area:
